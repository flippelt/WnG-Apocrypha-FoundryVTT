Examples include:</p>\n<p>Tybalus, Aetheus, Dalat, Kariyan, Basillaeus, Tristraen, Erasmian, Heracal, Tauramacchis, Nurthias, Hasturias, Artoris, Nathadian, Io, Harkhas, Constantin, Eratorius, Archimallus.</p>\n<h3><strong>Playing a Custodian</strong></h3>\n<p>If you wish to play a Custodian character, use the following species entry.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 330</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 5, Fellowship 3, Initiative 5, Intellect 3, Strength 6, Toughness 6, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics 4, Awareness 5, Ballistic Skill 4, Insight 3, Scholar 2, Stealth 3, Weapon Skill 4</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 7</p>\n<p><strong>Aegis of the Emperor:</strong> A Custodian may roll Determination against Mortal Wounds. Indomitable, Incorruptible: You add +2 to your Resolve, and you automatically succeed on all Corruption Tests. Your Maximum Wounds are increased by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Solitary:</strong> A Custodian maintains a unique pool of Glory. They may save up to 3 points of Glory, and they cannot save points into the group pool nor can they spend Glory generated by anyone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Despised by the Unholy:</strong> If a Custodian is present in a game, the GM’s starting and maximum Ruin are increased by 1.</p>\n<h5><strong>Additional Details </strong></h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Custodes are functionally immortal and will persist for centuries or millennia if not slain through extreme violence. If you’re randomly rolling for a Custodian character’s age, roll 4d6 x 5, and then multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> As transhumans, Custodians possess a similar range and variety of skin pigments, hair colours, and eye colours to baseline humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> Custodians typically stand taller than the Astartes and are close in height to the Primarchs of old. If you’re randomly rolling a Custodian character’s height, roll 8’ +2d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The Custodians speak Low Gothic and High Gothic and are often fluent in numerous obscure historical human languages, as well as other forms of communication, including the Thoughtmark and Battlemark sign languages used by the Silent Sisterhood, and Astartes battle-sign.</p>"},"_id":"zP4s74z3g5ktvIOa","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664835327245,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"}}

It was an event so terrible that not only did it kill trillions of Eldar, but it breached the gap between real space and the Warp, and gave birth to Slaanesh, a Chaos God.</p>\n<p>Life on the Eldar Worlds was idyllic, with fantastically sophisticated machines to take care of all labour and manufacturing required, leaving the Eldar free to indulge in other, more aesthetic pursuits. With all menial work taken care of for them, the Eldar became indolent and decadent. They began to explore more and more the arts of pleasure, delving ever deeper into hedonism.

The millennia of Eldar hedonism had made a massive impact in the psychic realm of Chaos. Within the warp the decadent Eldar civilisation was giving shape to a Power of Chaos, which grew and grew over thousands of years, getting stronger and more defined until suddenly it sparked into an intelligence - a shatteringly huge and malign intelligence, with an immense and bottomless thirst for Eldar souls. This was the birth of Slaanesh. The process lasted for thousands of years, corresponding to mankind's Age of Strife, although when Slaanesh finally came into being, the results with the universe were apocalyptic and sudden. An almighty psychic shockwave scythed across the galaxy. The souls of almost every Eldar were stripped from them in an instant and devoured by the new-born Chaos god. There were few survivors. Most were driven mad, their minds trapped half in the real world and half in the swirling insanity of the Warp. A great Warp rift was created, encompassing the entire Aeldari empire and creating the Eye of Terror.</p>\n<p>The denizens of Commorragh, however, were tucked away safely in the Webway, protected from Slaanesh and its thirst. Though much of the Webway was in ruin, they had endured and, unlike their Craftworld counterparts, remained unrepentant. Though they discovered Slaanesh was still slowly claiming their souls, the denizens of Commorragh soon discovered that by absorbing the pain and torments of another's soul they could rejuvenate themselves and cheat death. Assuming they could feed regularly, the Eldar of the Webway had become physically immune to the passage of time. Soon the Eldar of the Webway began raiding Realspace in search of captives and slaves to rejuvenate themselves with. So it was that the Dark Eldar were born, a race of sadistic murderers who feed upon the anguish of others to prevent the death of their immortal souls.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><em>THE <a class=\"keyword\">[KABAL]</a> KEYWORD</em></h3>\n<p>The Kabals are massive political entities, part noble house, part pirate warband, part economic power, and not dissimilar in structure to the criminal syndicates found on many Imperial worlds.</p>\n<p>If you have the <a class=\"keyword\">KABALITE</a> keyword, you will also have the <a class=\"keyword\">[KABAL]</a> Keyword, which is replaced with the name of the Kabal you are a member of.</p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE BLACK HEART</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE POISONED TONGUE</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE FLAYED SKULL</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE OBSIDIAN ROSE</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><em>THE <a class=\"keyword\">[CULT]</a> KEYWORD</em></h3>\n<p>Each Wych Cult is collective of gladiatorial fighters known as Wyches, or Hekatarii, whose battles entertain the masses of the Dark City, and whose skills can be hired by raiding parties when the price is right</p>\n<p>If you have the <a class=\"keyword\">WYCH</a> keyword, you will also have the <a class=\"keyword\">[CULT]</a> Keyword, which is replaced with the name of the Cult you are a member of.</p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE CULT OF STRIFE</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE CURSED BLADE</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE RED GRIEF</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><em>THE <a class=\"keyword\">[COVEN]</a> KEYWORD</em></h3>\n<p>The Haemonculi band together for mutual benefit, collaborating on research and experimentation, and providing services to the rest of the Dark City.

A great Warp rift was created, encompassing the entire Aeldari empire and creating the Eye of Terror.</p><p>The denizens of Commorragh, however, were tucked away safely in the Webway, protected from Slaanesh and its thirst. Though much of the Webway was in ruin, they had endured and, unlike their Craftworld counterparts, remained unrepentant. Though they discovered Slaanesh was still slowly claiming their souls, the denizens of Commorragh soon discovered that by absorbing the pain and torments of another's soul they could rejuvenate themselves and cheat death. Assuming they could feed regularly, the Eldar of the Webway had become physically immune to the passage of time. Soon the Eldar of the Webway began raiding Realspace in search of captives and slaves to rejuvenate themselves with. So it was that the Dark Eldar were born, a race of sadistic murderers who feed upon the anguish of others to prevent the death of their immortal souls.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3><em>THE </em><a class=\"keyword\"><em>[KABAL]</em></a><em> KEYWORD</em></h3><p>The Kabals are massive political entities, part noble house, part pirate warband, part economic power, and not dissimilar in structure to the criminal syndicates found on many Imperial worlds.</p><p>If you have the <a class=\"keyword\">KABALITE</a> keyword, you will also have the <a class=\"keyword\">[KABAL]</a> Keyword, which is replaced with the name of the Kabal you are a member of.</p><p><a class=\"keyword\"><em>THE BLACK HEART</em></a></p><p><a class=\"keyword\"><em>THE POISONED TONGUE</em></a></p><p><a class=\"keyword\"><em>THE FLAYED SKULL</em></a></p><p><a class=\"keyword\"><em>THE OBSIDIAN ROSE</em></a></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3><em>THE </em><a class=\"keyword\"><em>[CULT]</em></a><em> KEYWORD</em></h3><p>Each Wych Cult is collective of gladiatorial fighters known as Wyches, or Hekatarii, whose battles entertain the masses of the Dark City, and whose skills can be hired by raiding parties when the price is right</p><p>If you have the <a class=\"keyword\">WYCH</a> keyword, you will also have the <a class=\"keyword\">[CULT]</a> Keyword, which is replaced with the name of the Cult you are a member of.</p><p><a class=\"keyword\"><em>THE CULT OF STRIFE</em></a></p><p><a class=\"keyword\"><em>THE CURSED BLADE</em></a></p><p><a class=\"keyword\"><em>THE RED GRIEF</em></a></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3><em>THE </em><a class=\"keyword\"><em>[COVEN]</em></a><em> KEYWORD</em></h3><p>The Haemonculi band together for mutual benefit, collaborating on research and experimentation, and providing services to the rest of the Dark City.

You specialise in long-range reconnaissance operations, guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and assassinations.</strong></p><p>Pathfinder teams range far ahead of Hunter Cadres in search of enemy forces. They maintain a watch on the foe while remaining hidden, reporting details of the enemy’s nature and disposition by way of encrypted and undetectable communication systems. Pathfinder teams are also deployed in the role of aggressive patrol groups, maintaining dominance over a wide area around a stationary Hunter Cadre and detecting any enemy forces that attempt to approach. Occasionally, an entire Hunter Cadre of Pathfinders is tasked with a mission, such as exploring a newly discovered planet and ascertaining if it is suitable for colonisation.</p><p>Pathfinders are equipped with a range of specialised equipment to aid in their mission. Every member of the team wears Recon Armour and carries a Markerlight, a laser designator device attached to his firearm that projects an almost invisible, highly focused beam of light at a potential target. The Markerlight is networked to a support weapon platform such as a Hammerhead gunship and transmits precise targeting information to guide the fire of such units. When used to guide the armour-piercing Seeker Missiles carried as additional weapons on many Tau tanks, the Pathfinders can remain hidden as they call in devastatingly powerful and unerringly accurate fire right onto the target. Many Imperial troops have come to fear the small, red dot of light that appears on the body of those about to be slain, and some refer to it as the \"Valkyrie’s Mark.\" Pathfinders are called to sacrifice themselves more often than their basic Fire Warrior counterparts, though recklessly wasting lives is always anathema to the Tau. However, during the early days of the Great War of Confederation, Pathfinder teams sustained casualty rates of 84% or higher. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Fire Caste academies are overflowing with volunteers wishing to be Pathfinders.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Descended from the colonists sent to mine the resource-rich worlds of that region long ago, they were cut off from humanity during the Age of Strife, and evolved to suit their environments, becoming short, solid, and hardy folk.</p>\n<p>The Squats are a tenacious, grim people, hardened by the harsh environments of their stronghold-worlds, but they’re also loyal, hard-working, and honourable, and with an intellect and technical aptitude not often found in Abhumans. Indeed, so successful were they in settling their worlds that by the time the Great Crusades discovered them, they were given permission to remain autonomous of the Imperium, as allies rather than subjects. How they achieved such a feat is lost to time. Even then, the Squats were isolationist and inward-looking, seldom involving themselves in the affairs of the wider galaxy unless the galaxy came to them.</p>\n<p>During the Age of the Imperium, the many Leagues and Strongholds of the Squats saw a slow decline, their civilisation eroded by feuds and grudge-wars, to say nothing of the malign incursions of Xenos breeds – especially the Orks, who seemed to always find the Strongholds an enticing target – and the servants of Chaos. The populations of many failing Strongholds migrated to nearby Imperial worlds, integrating into the Imperium. When the Cicatrix Maledictum opened, tearing the galaxy in two, the Squat Homeworlds were caught within the middle of the rift, and precious few of the remaining Squats survived the cataclysm. Those who remained were offworld in expeditionary groups, were those who had joined the Imperium, or were outcasts and exiles in mercenary bands, and they are far too few to rebuild what they have lost.</p>\n<p>Squats are, as their name suggests, a short, sturdy people. They tend to have hard, broad features, with prominent noses, and male Squats always bear long, thick facial hair, often elaborately braided or styled. Though shorter than most humans, their broad frames and solid bodies suggest that they are far from weak or frail – indeed, the average Squat is more resilient than a baseline human.</p>\n<h3>Squat Roles</h3>\n<p>Squats could be found in all walks of life during the days of their civilisation, and many left the Homeworlds in seek of glory, adventure, or wealth, often aligning themselves with Rogue Traders, Adeptus Mechanicus Explorators, and others who range across the stars. Now, such wandering Squats are all who remain.</p>\n<p>Many Squats are miners and prospectors by trade, but all Squats are trained and armed to defend their homes from aggressors. In addition to being hardy, they’re strong and dextrous, and with unyielding resolve, especially now that they have so little left to lose. Some Squats have taken this to extremes, swearing oaths of vengeance and ruin upon the enemies of their kind, pledging to seek the destruction of those who have harmed the Squats with their dying breaths.</p>\n<p>Squats have a natural aptitude for technology, at least compared to most in the Imperium. Anyone looking at Squat technology in detail would see many things in common with the technology of the Imperium, but also many differences. Squat Engineers and the Priesthood of Mars have a similar technological base—humanity’s technical achievements in the distant past—but they have developed these technologies differently, through different conflicts and struggles, and to suit different circumstances. Millennia of living without the strictures of the Adeptus Mechanicus allowed the Squats to develop technologies unseen within the Imperium, and Squat Master Engineers were able to rival the Magi of Mars in their artifice.</p>\n<h5>Squat Names</h5>\n<p>Many Squat names are traditional, with a recurring use of names used by honoured ancestors from generations past, and often use a patronym or matronym (the name of a parent to indicate lineage) or clan name. Squats often also have a nickname or other earned identifier. Squats don’t get to choose their own nicknames—these are given to them by mentors and superiors during their apprentice years—and young Squats are caught in the tension between standing out enough to get a worthy moniker and not being so outlandish that they receive a shameful one. The following names are examples:</p>\n<p>Algunella, Athgni, Athlun, Balgrimella, Beladokina, Burnir, Burzin, Drokgrimella, Dronglin, Elanya, Elruna, Fimagrin, Fimarun, Gadrinella, Gimzin, Grendl, Grimgrund, Grimtoka, Hakakin, Harmin, Harnina, Kazgrond, Lundor, Moranina, Mori, Odaskina, Olfmir, Ollagona, Ollanya, Ragni, Rorangona, Rorgar, Skagromina, Skoraskina, Skordokina, Snoragund, Throngana, Thuramin, Uthagrund, Zakgni</p>\n<h3>Playing a Squat</h3>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 28</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 5</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Toughness 3, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Tech 1, Weapon Skill 2</p>\n<p><strong>Abhuman:</strong> +1DN to all Interaction tests with characters possessing the @Item[c1eM1YGFaqKckprQ]{IMPERIUM} keyword.</p>\n<p><strong>Grudges:</strong> +1d to all melee attacks against characters possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords. +2DN penalty on all non-hostile Interaction skill tests vs. targets possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords.</p>\n<p><strong>Legacy of the Cataclysm:</strong> Your Resolve and Conviction increase by +1 each.

Descended from the colonists sent to mine the resource-rich worlds of that region long ago, they were cut off from humanity during the Age of Strife, and evolved to suit their environments, becoming short, solid, and hardy folk.</p>\n<p>The Squats are a tenacious, grim people, hardened by the harsh environments of their stronghold-worlds, but they’re also loyal, hard-working, and honourable, and with an intellect and technical aptitude not often found in Abhumans. Indeed, so successful were they in settling their worlds that by the time the Great Crusades discovered them, they were given permission to remain autonomous of the Imperium, as allies rather than subjects. How they achieved such a feat is lost to time. Even then, the Squats were isolationist and inward-looking, seldom involving themselves in the affairs of the wider galaxy unless the galaxy came to them.</p>\n<p>During the Age of the Imperium, the many Leagues and Strongholds of the Squats saw a slow decline, their civilisation eroded by feuds and grudge-wars, to say nothing of the malign incursions of Xenos breeds – especially the Orks, who seemed to always find the Strongholds an enticing target – and the servants of Chaos. The populations of many failing Strongholds migrated to nearby Imperial worlds, integrating into the Imperium. When the Cicatrix Maledictum opened, tearing the galaxy in two, the Squat Homeworlds were caught within the middle of the rift, and precious few of the remaining Squats survived the cataclysm. Those who remained were offworld in expeditionary groups, were those who had joined the Imperium, or were outcasts and exiles in mercenary bands, and they are far too few to rebuild what they have lost.</p>\n<p>Squats are, as their name suggests, a short, sturdy people. They tend to have hard, broad features, with prominent noses, and male Squats always bear long, thick facial hair, often elaborately braided or styled. Though shorter than most humans, their broad frames and solid bodies suggest that they are far from weak or frail – indeed, the average Squat is more resilient than a baseline human.</p>\n<h3>Squat Roles</h3>\n<p>Squats could be found in all walks of life during the days of their civilisation, and many left the Homeworlds in seek of glory, adventure, or wealth, often aligning themselves with Rogue Traders, Adeptus Mechanicus Explorators, and others who range across the stars. Now, such wandering Squats are all who remain.</p>\n<p>Many Squats are miners and prospectors by trade, but all Squats are trained and armed to defend their homes from aggressors. In addition to being hardy, they’re strong and dextrous, and with unyielding resolve, especially now that they have so little left to lose. Some Squats have taken this to extremes, swearing oaths of vengeance and ruin upon the enemies of their kind, pledging to seek the destruction of those who have harmed the Squats with their dying breaths.</p>\n<p>Squats have a natural aptitude for technology, at least compared to most in the Imperium. Anyone looking at Squat technology in detail would see many things in common with the technology of the Imperium, but also many differences. Squat Engineers and the Priesthood of Mars have a similar technological base—humanity’s technical achievements in the distant past—but they have developed these technologies differently, through different conflicts and struggles, and to suit different circumstances. Millennia of living without the strictures of the Adeptus Mechanicus allowed the Squats to develop technologies unseen within the Imperium, and Squat Master Engineers were able to rival the Magi of Mars in their artifice.</p>\n<h5>Squat Names</h5>\n<p>Many Squat names are traditional, with a recurring use of names used by honoured ancestors from generations past, and often use a patronym or matronym (the name of a parent to indicate lineage) or clan name. Squats often also have a nickname or other earned identifier. Squats don’t get to choose their own nicknames—these are given to them by mentors and superiors during their apprentice years—and young Squats are caught in the tension between standing out enough to get a worthy moniker and not being so outlandish that they receive a shameful one. The following names are examples:</p>\n<p>Algunella, Athgni, Athlun, Balgrimella, Beladokina, Burnir, Burzin, Drokgrimella, Dronglin, Elanya, Elruna, Fimagrin, Fimarun, Gadrinella, Gimzin, Grendl, Grimgrund, Grimtoka, Hakakin, Harmin, Harnina, Kazgrond, Lundor, Moranina, Mori, Odaskina, Olfmir, Ollagona, Ollanya, Ragni, Rorangona, Rorgar, Skagromina, Skoraskina, Skordokina, Snoragund, Throngana, Thuramin, Uthagrund, Zakgni</p>\n<h3>Playing a Squat</h3>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 28</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 5</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Toughness 3, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Tech 1, Weapon Skill 2</p>\n<p><strong>Abhuman:</strong> +1DN to all Interaction tests with characters possessing the @Item[c1eM1YGFaqKckprQ]{IMPERIUM} keyword.</p>\n<p><strong>Grudges:</strong> +1d to all melee attacks against characters possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords. +2DN penalty on all non-hostile Interaction skill tests vs. targets possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords.</p>\n<p><strong>Legacy of the Cataclysm:</strong> Your Resolve and Conviction increase by +1 each.

These auxilia detachments are often used as cannon fodder, herded towards the enemy on the front lines to soak up fire from the enemy guns so that it doesn’t cause casualties in more valuable units.</p><p>The Beastmen are typically indoctrinated with a deep sense of shame for their nature, and taught that death in service, especially when killing the enemies of the Emperor, is a fitting way to atone for the sin of their existence. Lacking little in the way of education, this is normally sufficient to drive them into a fervour, such that they can be herded towards the enemy easily enough.</p><div class=\"journal-image

Each Stronghold was a largely independent community, with its own laws, traditions, and armies. If a world had more than one Stronghold – as many did – it was typical for one to be preeminent, so that it has nominal rule over the others.

Some Strongholds had alliances that endured for thousands of years, bonded so tightly that they were almost one people. Others were loose collections of individual fiefs, sharing the duty of patrolling nearby systems and defending outlying worlds against rampaging Orks or Chaos reavers.

When this weapon makes a Salvo attack, increase the weapon’s Blast rating by the weapon’s Salvo value.</p><h4>Cacophony</h4><p>Cacophony weapons use destructive wavelengths of sound to tear targets apart, and it is nigh-impossible to hide from them. Attacks with a Cacophony weapon ignore cover bonuses to defence.</p><h4>Careful</h4><p>A Careful Weapon requires precision and care to wield and cannot easily be used to make multiple rapid attacks. A Careful Weapon cannot be used to make a Multi-Attack.</p><h4>Corrupting</h4><p>This weapon directs the corrupting power of the Warp. For each Exalted Icon rolled on the weapon’s damage roll, the target gains 1 Corruption.</p><h4>Grav</h4><p>Grav weaponry turn their targets’ own mass against them. The weapon gains additional ED equal to half the target’s Resilience, and the target is Staggered until the end of its next turn if they suffer any wounds or shock from the attack.</p><h4>Haywire (X)</h4><p>Haywire weapons generate destructive electromagnetic pulses. When attacking a vehicle or mechanical foe, roll a number of d6 equal to the trait’s rating. Each Icon inflicts a Mortal Wound.</p><h4>Indirect</h4><p>The weapon can be fired at enemies which are not visible to the bearer, adding +2 to the DN. Enemies attacked indirectly do not receive any bonus to Defence for being in cover.</p><h4>Luminagen</h4><p>Phosphor weapons illuminate their targets with a searing light. A character hit by a Luminagen weapon cannot benefit from being in cover until the start of their next turn.</p><h4>Mortal (X)</h4><p>The weapon deals horrific, deadly wounds that are nigh-impossible to withstand. For each Exalted Icon you roll on the weapon’s ED, you inflict X Mortal Wounds, in addition to any damage the attack inflicts.</p><h4>Nemesis</h4><p>Nemesis weapons are created to be bane to daemons. @UUID[Item.eeSvJvzZBjQvtZq0]{DAEMONS }may not roll Determination to negate wounds or mortal wounds inflicted by Nemesis weapons.</p><h4>Overwhelming</h4><p>The weapon can batter past even the most proficient defence. When you make an attack with an Overwhelming weapon, the target does not benefit from the Parry trait of any of their weapons or the Defence bonus from Shields.</p><h4>Paired</h4><p>The weapon is designed to be used in a pair—two weapons of that type, one in each hand. When a character makes an attack while wielding both weapons in a pair, either count it as a Simultaneous Strike (as per the talent), or reduce the DN of a multiattack by 2. If you have the Signature Weapon talent, you may apply it to both weapons in a pair.</p><h4>Poisonous</h4><p>The weapon delivers a virulent toxin that inflicts grievous harm with only the slightest scratch. The weapon’s base damage is increased by the target’s Toughness. This has no effect against Vehicles.</p><h4>Reaping</h4><p>The weapon is intended to scythe through groups of foes. When you make a Multi-Attack with this weapon, the DN increases by +1 per additional target, rather than +2.</p><h4>Tearing</h4><p>The weapon rips and tears at their enemies, inflicting horrific wounds. When you roll for damage with this weapon, you may re-roll any number of ED.</p><h4>Tesla</h4><p>The weapon fires arcs of crackling lightning, leaping from foe to foe. When you shift Exalted Icons from a successful attack, you may shift Exalted Icons to hit enemies within 3m of an existing target as well as the main target, using the weapon’s normal damage and AP. Each Exalted Icon shifted may only be used to hit additional enemies or to gain +ED, not both.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ZFKuifc3mGn2RgTb.JournalEntryPage.anBLJX16REDKapOs"}}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_edpbxmeck8v","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Wargear","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1664024464297,"modifiedTime":1664835327408,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"},"_id":"ZFKuifc3mGn2RgTb","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3}}

In the wake of the Horus Heresy, they vanished almost entirely from the Imperium, and the order was wrongfully believed to have been disbanded.</p>\n<p>Yet the Sisters of Silence have recently returned to prominence in the Imperium of Man following the birth of the Great Rift and the start of the Era Indomitus.</p>\n<p>The Sisters of Silence's original purpose was to hunt and kill rogue human psykers whose activities presented a terrible danger to the people of the newborn Imperium of Man and to oversee the tithe of psykers from every Imperial world to Terra</p>\n<p>Each one of the warriors of this order are psychic Nulls, a soulless being who inspires dread wherever they walk. The Sisters of Silence's primary base of operations was the Somnus Citadel on Luna, the moon of Terra, which was maintained by the ancient Selenite Cults of gene-engineers who had long governed that world</p>\n<p>As Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade took shape and the first fleets were mustered, bands of Silent Sisters converged on Terra from every direction. Each isolated group had met different challenges through the generations, diverging to overcome them as necessity dictated. The tactics, characters, and traditions of each group were far removed from each other, but their collective sense of duty was undimmed.</p>\n<p>The hosts of Silent Sisters upon Terra eventually numbered near three thousand, and Guilliman declared them the Vigil Indomitus. They would be the first in a spreading network of vigils throughout the Imperium, each granted the explicit authority to carry out their ancient duties. The Vigil Indomitus divided into cadres, with each joining the battle groups of the Indomitus Crusade fleets.</p>\n<p>There had once been a large population of Sisters of Silence during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. Though numerous enough to play a role in the War of the Beast a thousand standard years after the end of the Heresy, by the late 41st Millennium they had dwindled almost to extinction. The militant orders of the Emperor's day had been disbanded, diminished, or lost to war.</p>\n<p>The last surviving few were scattered around the Imperium, most reduced to a handful of members. They had fought on, here and there, but their glory days were a myth at best. They were unremembered by the people they had died to protect.</p>\n<p>But after thousands of standard years of obscurity, when Guilliman returned, the Sisters of Silence came back willingly into the light, not because of who he was, but because of what he was. To them, the Primarch was a Living Saint.</p>\n<p>No longer centralised within the vast spire-convents of Luna, the Sisterhood has recently re-established a presence in every Segmentum, forming many new orders and offshoots. Some are charged with specific duties -- such as infiltrating the hyperspatial tunnels of the Webway to stymie the plans of psychic xenos races, recovering Pariahs from enemy forces that seek to use them for their own gain, or neutralizing spectral attacks in strategically vital locations.</p>\n<p>Others have carte blanche to pursue their own agendas, provided they culminate in the destruction of the Archenemy's forces. If there is any quality these genetic deviants share in abundance, it is self-reliance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Vow of Tranquility</h3>\n<p>Each Sister swears an oath of silence known as the Vow of Tranquility upon being nominated for Sisterhood; before this, when they are novices, they are allowed to converse normally. Amongst their other duties novices sometimes act as interpreters between senior Sisters and other agents of the Imperium.</p>\n<p>Thoughtmark is one of the symbolic sign languages employed by the Silent Sisterhood.

In the wake of the Horus Heresy, they vanished almost entirely from the Imperium, and the order was wrongfully believed to have been disbanded.</p>\n<p>Yet the Sisters of Silence have recently returned to prominence in the Imperium of Man following the birth of the Great Rift and the start of the Era Indomitus.</p>\n<p>The Sisters of Silence's original purpose was to hunt and kill rogue human psykers whose activities presented a terrible danger to the people of the newborn Imperium of Man and to oversee the tithe of psykers from every Imperial world to Terra</p>\n<p>Each one of the warriors of this order are psychic Nulls, a soulless being who inspires dread wherever they walk. The Sisters of Silence's primary base of operations was the Somnus Citadel on Luna, the moon of Terra, which was maintained by the ancient Selenite Cults of gene-engineers who had long governed that world</p>\n<p>As Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade took shape and the first fleets were mustered, bands of Silent Sisters converged on Terra from every direction. Each isolated group had met different challenges through the generations, diverging to overcome them as necessity dictated. The tactics, characters, and traditions of each group were far removed from each other, but their collective sense of duty was undimmed.</p>\n<p>The hosts of Silent Sisters upon Terra eventually numbered near three thousand, and Guilliman declared them the Vigil Indomitus. They would be the first in a spreading network of vigils throughout the Imperium, each granted the explicit authority to carry out their ancient duties. The Vigil Indomitus divided into cadres, with each joining the battle groups of the Indomitus Crusade fleets.</p>\n<p>There had once been a large population of Sisters of Silence during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. Though numerous enough to play a role in the War of the Beast a thousand standard years after the end of the Heresy, by the late 41st Millennium they had dwindled almost to extinction. The militant orders of the Emperor's day had been disbanded, diminished, or lost to war.</p>\n<p>The last surviving few were scattered around the Imperium, most reduced to a handful of members. They had fought on, here and there, but their glory days were a myth at best. They were unremembered by the people they had died to protect.</p>\n<p>But after thousands of standard years of obscurity, when Guilliman returned, the Sisters of Silence came back willingly into the light, not because of who he was, but because of what he was. To them, the Primarch was a Living Saint.</p>\n<p>No longer centralised within the vast spire-convents of Luna, the Sisterhood has recently re-established a presence in every Segmentum, forming many new orders and offshoots. Some are charged with specific duties -- such as infiltrating the hyperspatial tunnels of the Webway to stymie the plans of psychic xenos races, recovering Pariahs from enemy forces that seek to use them for their own gain, or neutralizing spectral attacks in strategically vital locations.</p>\n<p>Others have carte blanche to pursue their own agendas, provided they culminate in the destruction of the Archenemy's forces. If there is any quality these genetic deviants share in abundance, it is self-reliance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Vow of Tranquility</h3>\n<p>Each Sister swears an oath of silence known as the Vow of Tranquility upon being nominated for Sisterhood; before this, when they are novices, they are allowed to converse normally.

Fire Warriors, as soldiers of the Fire Caste are known, spend their entire lifetimes in battle or preparing for it, constantly honing their tactics, and working to improve their skills.

This often means that Arbites are well-travelled, with veterans having served on several worlds across multiple sectors during their storied careers.</p>\n<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> <em>The Adeptus Arbites as presented in this document are based on the Arbites as depicted in the Shira Calpurnia novels by Matt Farrer, which are available <a href=\"https:/www.blacklibrary.com/warhammer-40000/novels/enforcer-omnibus-ebook.html\">here</a>, but using the term Magistrates rather than Judges to describe the legal side of the Arbites.</em></p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%;height:1238px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:99.5703%;height:17px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\">ADEPTUS ARBITES ARCHETYPES</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:17px\">Tier</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:17px\">Archetype</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:17px\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Enforcer</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">Local law enforcement, often aligned with or deputised by the Arbites</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:68px;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Arbitrator</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">An armoured enforcer of the Emperor's Law, unyielding in their devotion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Magistrate</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A scholar of the Law, passing judgement upon the guilty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Detective</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A specialised investigator, assigned to solve more complex crimes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:51px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:51px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:51px\">Chastener</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:51px\">A dogged pursuer of those who would flee the Emperor's judgment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Verispex Adept</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A technician who studies the sceneof crimes to uncover evidence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:31px\">\n<td style=\"width:99.5703%;height:31px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\">\n<p>ADEPTUS ARBITES BACKGROUNDS</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:17px;text-align:center\">[[/r d3]]</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:17px\">Origin</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:17px;text-align:right\">Gain +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:51px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:51px;text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:51px\"><strong>Progena: </strong>Your parents were stalwart servants of the Throne, and after their deaths, you were raised by the Schola Progenium, who identified your talents and groomed you to join the Adeptus Arbites.</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:51px;text-align:right\">Influence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:85px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:85px;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:85px\"><strong>Repentant:</strong> You once lived a life of criminality and desperation before you found the Emperor’s light and saw the error of your ways.

You specialise in long-range reconnaissance operations, guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and assassinations.</strong></p><p>Pathfinder teams range far ahead of Hunter Cadres in search of enemy forces. They maintain a watch on the foe while remaining hidden, reporting details of the enemy’s nature and disposition by way of encrypted and undetectable communication systems. Pathfinder teams are also deployed in the role of aggressive patrol groups, maintaining dominance over a wide area around a stationary Hunter Cadre and detecting any enemy forces that attempt to approach. Occasionally, an entire Hunter Cadre of Pathfinders is tasked with a mission, such as exploring a newly discovered planet and ascertaining if it is suitable for colonisation.</p><p>Pathfinders are equipped with a range of specialised equipment to aid in their mission. Every member of the team wears Recon Armour and carries a Markerlight, a laser designator device attached to his firearm that projects an almost invisible, highly focused beam of light at a potential target. The Markerlight is networked to a support weapon platform such as a Hammerhead gunship and transmits precise targeting information to guide the fire of such units. When used to guide the armour-piercing Seeker Missiles carried as additional weapons on many Tau tanks, the Pathfinders can remain hidden as they call in devastatingly powerful and unerringly accurate fire right onto the target. Many Imperial troops have come to fear the small, red dot of light that appears on the body of those about to be slain, and some refer to it as the \"Valkyrie’s Mark.\" Pathfinders are called to sacrifice themselves more often than their basic Fire Warrior counterparts, though recklessly wasting lives is always anathema to the Tau. However, during the early days of the Great War of Confederation, Pathfinder teams sustained casualty rates of 84% or higher. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Fire Caste academies are overflowing with volunteers wishing to be Pathfinders.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

The Sisters of the Orders Famulous are skilled diplomats who perform many negotiations behind the scenes. Through their arranging of alliances and marriages, they take a direct hand in the fate of humanity, for those they counsel wield the power of whole planets and control the fates of billions. The servants of the Orders Famulous do not openly discuss this element of their work, even with other members of the Sisterhood, but many do appear to have extensive contact with members of the Inquisition, especially the Ordo Hereticus. Much of the work of the Orders Famulous also involves tracking the manifestation of saints, and they often become involved in the arcane process of determining whether or not.</p><p>The Orders Famulous also provide the Ecclesiarchy with watchful eyes throughout the Imperium, often serving as their spies who closely observe the dealings of influential individuals. Should these people go against the dictates of the Adeptus Ministorum, they may send reports that result in Confessors being sent to extract admissions of heresy. Powerful families that have held sway for generations may be eradicated entirely at the word of a Famulous Sister. In the course of their duties, Sisters Famulous often speak of how the Emperor manifests his will through his subjects, pointing to the miracles performed as Saints as evidence.</p><div

You do not yield while a fellow warrior continues to fight, and you do not despair when facing the enemy because your kin stand by your side.</strong></p><p>The primary military force of a Squat Stronghold was known as the War-Pledged, a translation of the original Squat term, Kazakbarazi, though some Imperial linguists have translated it as “Brotherhood” or “Hearthkyn”. Each Squat is obliged to enter service once they have raised at least two children to maturity, ensuring that military service does not threaten the continuity of the hold, and this service lasts for at least three decades. Upon returning home after their service, a Squat takes up a place within their family’s interests. Even after leaving service, however, the bonds formed in a War-Pledged Company last for generations, with each warrior forming a link in a chain that binds Strongholds together.</p><p>Companies of War-Pledged were often hired out as mercenary companies or expeditionary forces to further the goals of their Stronghold – for skill at arms is simply one more commodity that can be traded – and it was these ranging forces that most often survived the cataclysm, when the rift opened and swallowed the Homeworlds. These forces are now scattered and isolated, often searching for other survivors or seeking vengeance on the enemies of their people.</p><p>Squat warriors gained a reputation for their fondness for guns, and even before the cataclysm, no Squat away from home would travel without at least one sidearm, typically a large-calibre pistol of some kind.</p><table style=\"width:98.9228%;height:239px\"

They have been granted the right by the High Lords of Terra to serve as judge, jury, and executioner to any Imperial citizen they discover having broken Imperial law.</p>\n<p>However, in those cases where Imperial law is unclear or the law breaker has committed a truly heinous deed or is of unusually high-ranking stature, the offender will be taken back to an Arbites Precinct House for judgement by a Magistrate or Judge, the sentence to be carried out immediately. Imperial justice is swift and sure, but not always just.</p>\n<p>Only through constant watch and the execution of brutal law can the Imperium survive, and it is the Adeptus Arbites who carry out this function. While the armies of the Astra Militarum struggle to hold back the aggression of alien empires and protect the worlds of Mankind from without, the Adeptus Arbites roots out rebels, recidivists, and threats to the stability of the Imperium from within.</p>\n<p>They operate as they best see fit, using their greater training and weaponry to tackle foes that might be beyond the scope of local Enforcers, or in many cases to deal with a planetary government which has itself become corrupted. Remorseless and singleminded, the Arbites do not forgive or forget any crime, and pursue their quarry relentlessly until the Emperor's Justice has been served.</p>\n<p>The laws of the Imperium of Man are a complex web of tradition, obligation, and local custom. Thus, they can vary from world to world or sector to sector, with each Planetary Governor, local prefect, or headman pronouncing his own laws. Arbitors care little for such trivialities and enforce the serious crimes against the Imperium while leaving such petty matters to local officials. Murder or theft, for example, are considered inconsequential unless they affect the Imperium directly, are perpetrated against Imperial officials, or somehow fundamentally threaten a world’s security or safety.</p>\n<p>Arbitors have little pity or compassion for the transgressions of Imperial citizens. A few might maintain idealistic notions for bringing order to the Imperium, but the realities of endless, sometimes horrific crimes constantly erode such notions. The arrival of an Arbitrator patrol is seldom welcome, given the brutal way in which they operate during their investigations, arrests, and executions, even though it might mean an end to vicious criminal enterprises or corrupt Imperial or planetary officials.</p>\n<p>Arbitors must deal with ineffectual or corrupt local government agencies. These are often an Arbitor’s greatest foes as he must clean up a local situation, taking over the Enforcers of a hive city, orbital station, or even entire planet to purge it of crime and corruption in a series of bloody and unforgiving sweeps.</p>\n<p>On Imperial worlds the Adeptus Arbites are the last, most absolute law, answering only to the Marshalls and Judges of star systems and entire sectors, and not to local authorities. It is a thankless task, for the anonymous, helmeted Arbitrator usually only receives fear and hatred for his actions.</p>\n<p>To ensure their loyalty is to the Imperium and the Law first, foremost, and only, Arbitors never serve on the world upon which they were born. Indeed, they will receive training on one world and then be deployed to another entirely, ensuring that bonds of local familiarity cannot compromise enforcement of the law.

They have been granted the right by the High Lords of Terra to serve as judge, jury, and executioner to any Imperial citizen they discover having broken Imperial law.</p><p>However, in those cases where Imperial law is unclear or the law breaker has committed a truly heinous deed or is of unusually high-ranking stature, the offender will be taken back to an Arbites Precinct House for judgement by a Magistrate or Judge, the sentence to be carried out immediately. Imperial justice is swift and sure, but not always just.</p><p>Only through constant watch and the execution of brutal law can the Imperium survive, and it is the Adeptus Arbites who carry out this function. While the armies of the Astra Militarum struggle to hold back the aggression of alien empires and protect the worlds of Mankind from without, the Adeptus Arbites roots out rebels, recidivists, and threats to the stability of the Imperium from within.</p><p>They operate as they best see fit, using their greater training and weaponry to tackle foes that might be beyond the scope of local Enforcers, or in many cases to deal with a planetary government which has itself become corrupted. Remorseless and singleminded, the Arbites do not forgive or forget any crime, and pursue their quarry relentlessly until the Emperor's Justice has been served.</p><p>The laws of the Imperium of Man are a complex web of tradition, obligation, and local custom. Thus, they can vary from world to world or sector to sector, with each Planetary Governor, local prefect, or headman pronouncing his own laws. Arbitors care little for such trivialities and enforce the serious crimes against the Imperium while leaving such petty matters to local officials. Murder or theft, for example, are considered inconsequential unless they affect the Imperium directly, are perpetrated against Imperial officials, or somehow fundamentally threaten a world’s security or safety.</p><p>Arbitors have little pity or compassion for the transgressions of Imperial citizens. A few might maintain idealistic notions for bringing order to the Imperium, but the realities of endless, sometimes horrific crimes constantly erode such notions. The arrival of an Arbitrator patrol is seldom welcome, given the brutal way in which they operate during their investigations, arrests, and executions, even though it might mean an end to vicious criminal enterprises or corrupt Imperial or planetary officials.</p><p>Arbitors must deal with ineffectual or corrupt local government agencies. These are often an Arbitor’s greatest foes as he must clean up a local situation, taking over the Enforcers of a hive city, orbital station, or even entire planet to purge it of crime and corruption in a series of bloody and unforgiving sweeps.</p><p>On Imperial worlds the Adeptus Arbites are the last, most absolute law, answering only to the Marshalls and Judges of star systems and entire sectors, and not to local authorities. It is a thankless task, for the anonymous, helmeted Arbitrator usually only receives fear and hatred for his actions.</p><p>To ensure their loyalty is to the Imperium and the Law first, foremost, and only, Arbitors never serve on the world upon which they were born. Indeed, they will receive training on one world and then be deployed to another entirely, ensuring that bonds of local familiarity cannot compromise enforcement of the law. This often means that Arbites are well-travelled, with veterans having served on several worlds across multiple sectors during their storied careers.</p><p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> <em>The Adeptus Arbites as presented in this document are based on the Arbites as depicted in the Shira Calpurnia novels by Matt Farrer, which are available </em><a href=\"https://www.blacklibrary.com/warhammer-40000/novels/enforcer-omnibus-ebook.html\"><em>here</em></a><em>, but using the term Magistrates rather than Judges to describe the legal side of the Arbites.</em></p><table style=\"width:99.1477%;height:1238px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"width:99.5703%;height:17px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\">ADEPTUS ARBITES ARCHETYPES</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:17px\">Tier</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:17px\">Archetype</td><td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:17px\">Description</td></tr><tr style=\"height:68px\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">1</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">@UUID[JournalEntry.AQGUymqsB8knipBc]{Enforcer}</td><td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">Local law enforcement, often aligned with or deputised by the Arbites</td></tr><tr style=\"height:68px\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:68px;text-align:center\">2</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Arbitrator</td><td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">An armoured enforcer of the Emperor's Law, unyielding in their devotion</td></tr><tr style=\"height:68px\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">2</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Magistrate</td><td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A scholar of the Law, passing judgement upon the guilty</td></tr><tr style=\"height:68px\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">3</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Detective</td><td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A specialised investigator, assigned to solve more complex crimes</td></tr><tr style=\"height:51px\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:51px\">3</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:51px\">Chastener</td><td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:51px\">A dogged pursuer of those who would flee the Emperor's judgment</td></tr><tr style=\"height:68px\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">3</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Verispex Adept</td><td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A technician who studies the sceneof crimes to uncover evidence</td></tr><tr style=\"height:31px\"><td style=\"width:99.5703%;height:31px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\"><p>ADEPTUS ARBITES BACKGROUNDS</p></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:17px;text-align:center\">[[/r d3]]</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:17px\">Origin</td><td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:17px;text-align:right\">Gain +1</td></tr><tr style=\"height:51px\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:51px;text-align:center\">1</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:51px\"><strong>Progena: </strong>Your parents were stalwart servants of the Throne, and after their deaths, you were raised by the Schola Progenium, who identified your talents and groomed you to join the Adeptus Arbites.</td><td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:51px;text-align:right\">Influence</td></tr><tr style=\"height:85px\"><td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:85px;text-align:center\">2</td><td style=\"width:64.294%;height:85px\"><strong>Repentant:</strong> You once lived a life of criminality and desperation before you found the Emperor’s light and saw the error of your ways.

They are to the Space Marines as the Emperor is to His Primarchs, and it is rumoured that they were each created by the Master of Mankind personally.</p>\n<p>These warriors have stood in the presence of the immortal Emperor of Mankind since before the time of the Unification Wars. For ten thousand Terran years and more, the Custodians have stood watch over their lord and master, serving as the Emperor's personal heralds and praetorian bodyguard.</p>\n<p>During the Great Crusade, these resplendent warriors guarded the Emperor wherever He went and swore to give their lives to protect His.

In the wake of the Horus Heresy, they vanished almost entirely from the Imperium, and the order was wrongfully believed to have been disbanded.</p>\n<p>Yet the Sisters of Silence have recently returned to prominence in the Imperium of Man following the birth of the Great Rift and the start of the Era Indomitus.</p>\n<p>The Sisters of Silence's original purpose was to hunt and kill rogue human psykers whose activities presented a terrible danger to the people of the newborn Imperium of Man and to oversee the tithe of psykers from every Imperial world to Terra</p>\n<p>Each one of the warriors of this order are psychic Nulls, a soulless being who inspires dread wherever they walk. The Sisters of Silence's primary base of operations was the Somnus Citadel on Luna, the moon of Terra, which was maintained by the ancient Selenite Cults of gene-engineers who had long governed that world</p>\n<p>As Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade took shape and the first fleets were mustered, bands of Silent Sisters converged on Terra from every direction. Each isolated group had met different challenges through the generations, diverging to overcome them as necessity dictated. The tactics, characters, and traditions of each group were far removed from each other, but their collective sense of duty was undimmed.</p>\n<p>The hosts of Silent Sisters upon Terra eventually numbered near three thousand, and Guilliman declared them the Vigil Indomitus. They would be the first in a spreading network of vigils throughout the Imperium, each granted the explicit authority to carry out their ancient duties. The Vigil Indomitus divided into cadres, with each joining the battle groups of the Indomitus Crusade fleets.</p>\n<p>There had once been a large population of Sisters of Silence during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. Though numerous enough to play a role in the War of the Beast a thousand standard years after the end of the Heresy, by the late 41st Millennium they had dwindled almost to extinction. The militant orders of the Emperor's day had been disbanded, diminished, or lost to war.</p>\n<p>The last surviving few were scattered around the Imperium, most reduced to a handful of members. They had fought on, here and there, but their glory days were a myth at best. They were unremembered by the people they had died to protect.</p>\n<p>But after thousands of standard years of obscurity, when Guilliman returned, the Sisters of Silence came back willingly into the light, not because of who he was, but because of what he was. To them, the Primarch was a Living Saint.</p>\n<p>No longer centralised within the vast spire-convents of Luna, the Sisterhood has recently re-established a presence in every Segmentum, forming many new orders and offshoots. Some are charged with specific duties -- such as infiltrating the hyperspatial tunnels of the Webway to stymie the plans of psychic xenos races, recovering Pariahs from enemy forces that seek to use them for their own gain, or neutralizing spectral attacks in strategically vital locations.</p>\n<p>Others have carte blanche to pursue their own agendas, provided they culminate in the destruction of the Archenemy's forces. If there is any quality these genetic deviants share in abundance, it is self-reliance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Vow of Tranquility</h3>\n<p>Each Sister swears an oath of silence known as the Vow of Tranquility upon being nominated for Sisterhood; before this, when they are novices, they are allowed to converse normally. Amongst their other duties novices sometimes act as interpreters between senior Sisters and other agents of the Imperium.</p>\n<p>Thoughtmark is one of the symbolic sign languages employed by the Silent Sisterhood.

In the wake of the Horus Heresy, they vanished almost entirely from the Imperium, and the order was wrongfully believed to have been disbanded.</p>\n<p>Yet the Sisters of Silence have recently returned to prominence in the Imperium of Man following the birth of the Great Rift and the start of the Era Indomitus.</p>\n<p>The Sisters of Silence's original purpose was to hunt and kill rogue human psykers whose activities presented a terrible danger to the people of the newborn Imperium of Man and to oversee the tithe of psykers from every Imperial world to Terra</p>\n<p>Each one of the warriors of this order are psychic Nulls, a soulless being who inspires dread wherever they walk. The Sisters of Silence's primary base of operations was the Somnus Citadel on Luna, the moon of Terra, which was maintained by the ancient Selenite Cults of gene-engineers who had long governed that world</p>\n<p>As Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade took shape and the first fleets were mustered, bands of Silent Sisters converged on Terra from every direction. Each isolated group had met different challenges through the generations, diverging to overcome them as necessity dictated. The tactics, characters, and traditions of each group were far removed from each other, but their collective sense of duty was undimmed.</p>\n<p>The hosts of Silent Sisters upon Terra eventually numbered near three thousand, and Guilliman declared them the Vigil Indomitus. They would be the first in a spreading network of vigils throughout the Imperium, each granted the explicit authority to carry out their ancient duties. The Vigil Indomitus divided into cadres, with each joining the battle groups of the Indomitus Crusade fleets.</p>\n<p>There had once been a large population of Sisters of Silence during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. Though numerous enough to play a role in the War of the Beast a thousand standard years after the end of the Heresy, by the late 41st Millennium they had dwindled almost to extinction. The militant orders of the Emperor's day had been disbanded, diminished, or lost to war.</p>\n<p>The last surviving few were scattered around the Imperium, most reduced to a handful of members. They had fought on, here and there, but their glory days were a myth at best. They were unremembered by the people they had died to protect.</p>\n<p>But after thousands of standard years of obscurity, when Guilliman returned, the Sisters of Silence came back willingly into the light, not because of who he was, but because of what he was. To them, the Primarch was a Living Saint.</p>\n<p>No longer centralised within the vast spire-convents of Luna, the Sisterhood has recently re-established a presence in every Segmentum, forming many new orders and offshoots. Some are charged with specific duties -- such as infiltrating the hyperspatial tunnels of the Webway to stymie the plans of psychic xenos races, recovering Pariahs from enemy forces that seek to use them for their own gain, or neutralizing spectral attacks in strategically vital locations.</p>\n<p>Others have carte blanche to pursue their own agendas, provided they culminate in the destruction of the Archenemy's forces. If there is any quality these genetic deviants share in abundance, it is self-reliance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Vow of Tranquility</h3>\n<p>Each Sister swears an oath of silence known as the Vow of Tranquility upon being nominated for Sisterhood; before this, when they are novices, they are allowed to converse normally.

Instead, each Custodian answers to a name of their choosing, often some moniker of note from Terran history or legend. Each accepts additional names throughout their lives, etched microscopically within their armour as a testament to their accomplishments; the mightiest Custodians may have dozens, even hundreds of names. Examples include:</p>\n<p>Tybalus, Aetheus, Dalat, Kariyan, Basillaeus, Tristraen, Erasmian, Heracal, Tauramacchis, Nurthias, Hasturias, Artoris, Nathadian, Io, Harkhas, Constantin, Eratorius, Archimallus.</p>\n<h3><strong>Playing a Custodian</strong></h3>\n<p>If you wish to play a Custodian character, use the following species entry.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 330</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 5, Fellowship 3, Initiative 5, Intellect 3, Strength 6, Toughness 6, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics 4, Awareness 5, Ballistic Skill 4, Insight 3, Scholar 2, Stealth 3, Weapon Skill 4</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 7</p>\n<p><strong>Aegis of the Emperor:</strong> A Custodian may roll Determination against Mortal Wounds. Indomitable, Incorruptible: You add +2 to your Resolve, and you automatically succeed on all Corruption Tests. Your Maximum Wounds are increased by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Solitary:</strong> A Custodian maintains a unique pool of Glory. They may save up to 3 points of Glory, and they cannot save points into the group pool nor can they spend Glory generated by anyone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Despised by the Unholy:</strong> If a Custodian is present in a game, the GM’s starting and maximum Ruin are increased by 1.</p>\n<h5><strong>Additional Details </strong></h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Custodes are functionally immortal and will persist for centuries or millennia if not slain through extreme violence. If you’re randomly rolling for a Custodian character’s age, roll 4d6 x 5, and then multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> As transhumans, Custodians possess a similar range and variety of skin pigments, hair colours, and eye colours to baseline humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> Custodians typically stand taller than the Astartes and are close in height to the Primarchs of old. If you’re randomly rolling a Custodian character’s height, roll 8’ +2d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The Custodians speak Low Gothic and High Gothic and are often fluent in numerous obscure historical human languages, as well as other forms of communication, including the Thoughtmark and Battlemark sign languages used by the Silent Sisterhood, and Astartes battle-sign.</p>"},"_id":"zP4s74z3g5ktvIOa","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1665790874491,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"}}

For each Exalted Icon you roll on the weapon’s ED, you inflict X Mortal Wounds, in addition to any damage the attack inflicts.</p><h4>Nemesis</h4><p>Nemesis weapons are created to be bane to daemons. @UUID[Item.eeSvJvzZBjQvtZq0]{DAEMONS }may not roll Determination to negate wounds or mortal wounds inflicted by Nemesis weapons.</p><h4>Overwhelming</h4><p>The weapon can batter past even the most proficient defence. When you make an attack with an Overwhelming weapon, the target does not benefit from the Parry trait of any of their weapons or the Defence bonus from Shields.</p><h4>Paired</h4><p>The weapon is designed to be used in a pair—two weapons of that type, one in each hand. When a character makes an attack while wielding both weapons in a pair, either count it as a Simultaneous Strike (as per the talent), or reduce the DN of a multiattack by 2. If you have the Signature Weapon talent, you may apply it to both weapons in a pair.</p><h4>Poisonous</h4><p>The weapon delivers a virulent toxin that inflicts grievous harm with only the slightest scratch. The weapon’s base damage is increased by the target’s Toughness. This has no effect against Vehicles.</p><h4>Reaping</h4><p>The weapon is intended to scythe through groups of foes. When you make a Multi-Attack with this weapon, the DN increases by +1 per additional target, rather than +2.</p><h4>Tearing</h4><p>The weapon rips and tears at their enemies, inflicting horrific wounds. When you roll for damage with this weapon, you may re-roll any number of ED.</p><h4>Tesla</h4><p>The weapon fires arcs of crackling lightning, leaping from foe to foe. When you shift Exalted Icons from a successful attack, you may shift Exalted Icons to hit enemies within 3m of an existing target as well as the main target, using the weapon’s normal damage and AP. Each Exalted Icon shifted may only be used to hit additional enemies or to gain +ED, not both.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ZFKuifc3mGn2RgTb.JournalEntryPage.anBLJX16REDKapOs"}}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_edpbxmeck8v","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Wargear","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1664024464297,"modifiedTime":1665790874688,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"},"_id":"ZFKuifc3mGn2RgTb","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3}}
