Examples include:</p>\n<p>Tybalus, Aetheus, Dalat, Kariyan, Basillaeus, Tristraen, Erasmian, Heracal, Tauramacchis, Nurthias, Hasturias, Artoris, Nathadian, Io, Harkhas, Constantin, Eratorius, Archimallus.</p>\n<h3><strong>Playing a Custodian</strong></h3>\n<p>If you wish to play a Custodian character, use the following species entry.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 330</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 5, Fellowship 3, Initiative 5, Intellect 3, Strength 6, Toughness 6, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics 4, Awareness 5, Ballistic Skill 4, Insight 3, Scholar 2, Stealth 3, Weapon Skill 4</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 7</p>\n<p><strong>Aegis of the Emperor:</strong> A Custodian may roll Determination against Mortal Wounds. Indomitable, Incorruptible: You add +2 to your Resolve, and you automatically succeed on all Corruption Tests. Your Maximum Wounds are increased by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Solitary:</strong> A Custodian maintains a unique pool of Glory. They may save up to 3 points of Glory, and they cannot save points into the group pool nor can they spend Glory generated by anyone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Despised by the Unholy:</strong> If a Custodian is present in a game, the GM’s starting and maximum Ruin are increased by 1.</p>\n<h5><strong>Additional Details </strong></h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Custodes are functionally immortal and will persist for centuries or millennia if not slain through extreme violence. If you’re randomly rolling for a Custodian character’s age, roll 4d6 x 5, and then multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> As transhumans, Custodians possess a similar range and variety of skin pigments, hair colours, and eye colours to baseline humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> Custodians typically stand taller than the Astartes and are close in height to the Primarchs of old. If you’re randomly rolling a Custodian character’s height, roll 8’ +2d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The Custodians speak Low Gothic and High Gothic and are often fluent in numerous obscure historical human languages, as well as other forms of communication, including the Thoughtmark and Battlemark sign languages used by the Silent Sisterhood, and Astartes battle-sign.</p>"},"_id":"zP4s74z3g5ktvIOa","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664025245857,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"}}

It was an event so terrible that not only did it kill trillions of Eldar, but it breached the gap between real space and the Warp, and gave birth to Slaanesh, a Chaos God.</p>\n<p>Life on the Eldar Worlds was idyllic, with fantastically sophisticated machines to take care of all labour and manufacturing required, leaving the Eldar free to indulge in other, more aesthetic pursuits. With all menial work taken care of for them, the Eldar became indolent and decadent. They began to explore more and more the arts of pleasure, delving ever deeper into hedonism. This descent into decadence spanned millennia. Tradition and order disintegrated, as they limited the pursuit of pleasure. Sects called Pleasure Cults were formed, dedicated to achieving the highest levels of hedonistic sensation, and their ceremonies and practices became ever wilder, eventually devolving into violence and sacrifice of their own kind. Some Eldar hated what their race had become and left the homeworlds, leaving the Pleasure Cults to their madness. Building realms and outposts within the Webway to act as ports for inter-galactic travel, the city of Commorragh was founded. Isolated within the Webway, Commorragh itself soon became a bastion for pleasure cults and increasingly depraved acts.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, something terrible was stirring in the Warp. The millennia of Eldar hedonism had made a massive impact in the psychic realm of Chaos. Within the warp the decadent Eldar civilisation was giving shape to a Power of Chaos, which grew and grew over thousands of years, getting stronger and more defined until suddenly it sparked into an intelligence - a shatteringly huge and malign intelligence, with an immense and bottomless thirst for Eldar souls. This was the birth of Slaanesh. The process lasted for thousands of years, corresponding to mankind's Age of Strife, although when Slaanesh finally came into being, the results with the universe were apocalyptic and sudden. An almighty psychic shockwave scythed across the galaxy. The souls of almost every Eldar were stripped from them in an instant and devoured by the new-born Chaos god. There were few survivors. Most were driven mad, their minds trapped half in the real world and half in the swirling insanity of the Warp. A great Warp rift was created, encompassing the entire Aeldari empire and creating the Eye of Terror.</p>\n<p>The denizens of Commorragh, however, were tucked away safely in the Webway, protected from Slaanesh and its thirst. Though much of the Webway was in ruin, they had endured and, unlike their Craftworld counterparts, remained unrepentant. Though they discovered Slaanesh was still slowly claiming their souls, the denizens of Commorragh soon discovered that by absorbing the pain and torments of another's soul they could rejuvenate themselves and cheat death. Assuming they could feed regularly, the Eldar of the Webway had become physically immune to the passage of time. Soon the Eldar of the Webway began raiding Realspace in search of captives and slaves to rejuvenate themselves with. So it was that the Dark Eldar were born, a race of sadistic murderers who feed upon the anguish of others to prevent the death of their immortal souls.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><em>THE <a class=\"keyword\">[KABAL]</a> KEYWORD</em></h3>\n<p>The Kabals are massive political entities, part noble house, part pirate warband, part economic power, and not dissimilar in structure to the criminal syndicates found on many Imperial worlds.</p>\n<p>If you have the <a class=\"keyword\">KABALITE</a> keyword, you will also have the <a class=\"keyword\">[KABAL]</a> Keyword, which is replaced with the name of the Kabal you are a member of.</p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE BLACK HEART</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE POISONED TONGUE</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE FLAYED SKULL</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE OBSIDIAN ROSE</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><em>THE <a class=\"keyword\">[CULT]</a> KEYWORD</em></h3>\n<p>Each Wych Cult is collective of gladiatorial fighters known as Wyches, or Hekatarii, whose battles entertain the masses of the Dark City, and whose skills can be hired by raiding parties when the price is right</p>\n<p>If you have the <a class=\"keyword\">WYCH</a> keyword, you will also have the <a class=\"keyword\">[CULT]</a> Keyword, which is replaced with the name of the Cult you are a member of.</p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE CULT OF STRIFE</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE CURSED BLADE</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a class=\"keyword\">THE RED GRIEF</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3><em>THE <a class=\"keyword\">[COVEN]</a> KEYWORD</em></h3>\n<p>The Haemonculi band together for mutual benefit, collaborating on research and experimentation, and providing services to the rest of the Dark City.

A few discover that the extent of their abilities and hire themselves out as freelance witch-hunters and wyrdbanes, or as bodyguards to the paranoid.</p>\n<h3>Playing a Pariah</h3>\n<p>Any Human character may be chosen to be a Pariah during character creation. This has an additional XP cost, and applies additional special abilities to the character, but it also comes with some penalties and restrictions too.</p>\n<p>This additional cost must be paid if you choose any Human archetype. It is already included in the cost of all Pariah archetypes.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 30</p>\n<p><strong>Abhorrent Presence:</strong> +2DN to all interaction tests with non-pariah characters. +4DN to interaction tests with @Item[JVz6FoVEc7p1DJUj]{PSYKERS}. Pariahs reduce their Influence by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychic Abomination:</strong> A pariah cannot be directly affected by psychic powers or other warp phenomena, whether positive or negative. A pariah can never gain the @Item[JVz6FoVEc7p1DJUj]{PSYKER} keyword, nor can they ever gain Faith points or any other ability that requires drawing upon the Warp for power. Any psychic powers attempted or targeted within a number of metres of the Pariah equal to their Willpower increase their DN by twice the Pariah’s Rank.</p>\n<p><strong>Untouchable:</strong> A pariah cannot gain Corruption from warp phenomena, and they automatically succeed at Resolve tests caused by @Item[eeSvJvzZBjQvtZq0]{DAEMONS}.</p>"},"_id":"TgId5n8v6aobrm24","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664025245941,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"}}

When this weapon makes a Salvo attack, increase the weapon’s Blast rating by the weapon’s Salvo value.</p><h4>Cacophony</h4><p>Cacophony weapons use destructive wavelengths of sound to tear targets apart, and it is nigh-impossible to hide from them. Attacks with a Cacophony weapon ignore cover bonuses to defence.</p><h4>Careful</h4><p>A Careful Weapon requires precision and care to wield and cannot easily be used to make multiple rapid attacks. A Careful Weapon cannot be used to make a Multi-Attack.</p><h4>Corrupting</h4><p>This weapon directs the corrupting power of the Warp. For each Exalted Icon rolled on the weapon’s damage roll, the target gains 1 Corruption.</p><h4>Grav</h4><p>Grav weaponry turn their targets’ own mass against them. The weapon gains additional ED equal to half the target’s Resilience, and the target is Staggered until the end of its next turn if they suffer any wounds or shock from the attack.</p><h4>Haywire (X)</h4><p>Haywire weapons generate destructive electromagnetic pulses. When attacking a vehicle or mechanical foe, roll a number of d6 equal to the trait’s rating. Each Icon inflicts a Mortal Wound.</p><h4>Indirect</h4><p>The weapon can be fired at enemies which are not visible to the bearer, adding +2 to the DN. Enemies attacked indirectly do not receive any bonus to Defence for being in cover.</p><h4>Luminagen</h4><p>Phosphor weapons illuminate their targets with a searing light. A character hit by a Luminagen weapon cannot benefit from being in cover until the start of their next turn.</p><h4>Mortal (X)</h4><p>The weapon deals horrific, deadly wounds that are nigh-impossible to withstand. For each Exalted Icon you roll on the weapon’s ED, you inflict X Mortal Wounds, in addition to any damage the attack inflicts.</p><h4>Nemesis</h4><p>Nemesis weapons are created to be bane to daemons. @UUID[Item.eeSvJvzZBjQvtZq0]{DAEMONS }may not roll Determination to negate wounds or mortal wounds inflicted by Nemesis weapons.</p><h4>Overwhelming</h4><p>The weapon can batter past even the most proficient defence. When you make an attack with an Overwhelming weapon, the target does not benefit from the Parry trait of any of their weapons or the Defence bonus from Shields.</p><h4>Paired</h4><p>The weapon is designed to be used in a pair—two weapons of that type, one in each hand. When a character makes an attack while wielding both weapons in a pair, either count it as a Simultaneous Strike (as per the talent), or reduce the DN of a multiattack by 2. If you have the Signature Weapon talent, you may apply it to both weapons in a pair.</p><h4>Poisonous</h4><p>The weapon delivers a virulent toxin that inflicts grievous harm with only the slightest scratch. The weapon’s base damage is increased by the target’s Toughness. This has no effect against Vehicles.</p><h4>Reaping</h4><p>The weapon is intended to scythe through groups of foes. When you make a Multi-Attack with this weapon, the DN increases by +1 per additional target, rather than +2.</p><h4>Tearing</h4><p>The weapon rips and tears at their enemies, inflicting horrific wounds. When you roll for damage with this weapon, you may re-roll any number of ED.</p><h4>Tesla</h4><p>The weapon fires arcs of crackling lightning, leaping from foe to foe. When you shift Exalted Icons from a successful attack, you may shift Exalted Icons to hit enemies within 3m of an existing target as well as the main target, using the weapon’s normal damage and AP. Each Exalted Icon shifted may only be used to hit additional enemies or to gain +ED, not both.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ZFKuifc3mGn2RgTb.JournalEntryPage.anBLJX16REDKapOs"}}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_edpbxmeck8v","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Wargear","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1664024464297,"modifiedTime":1664025246062,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"},"_id":"ZFKuifc3mGn2RgTb","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3}}

In the wake of the Horus Heresy, they vanished almost entirely from the Imperium, and the order was wrongfully believed to have been disbanded.</p>\n<p>Yet the Sisters of Silence have recently returned to prominence in the Imperium of Man following the birth of the Great Rift and the start of the Era Indomitus.</p>\n<p>The Sisters of Silence's original purpose was to hunt and kill rogue human psykers whose activities presented a terrible danger to the people of the newborn Imperium of Man and to oversee the tithe of psykers from every Imperial world to Terra</p>\n<p>Each one of the warriors of this order are psychic Nulls, a soulless being who inspires dread wherever they walk. The Sisters of Silence's primary base of operations was the Somnus Citadel on Luna, the moon of Terra, which was maintained by the ancient Selenite Cults of gene-engineers who had long governed that world</p>\n<p>As Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade took shape and the first fleets were mustered, bands of Silent Sisters converged on Terra from every direction. Each isolated group had met different challenges through the generations, diverging to overcome them as necessity dictated. The tactics, characters, and traditions of each group were far removed from each other, but their collective sense of duty was undimmed.</p>\n<p>The hosts of Silent Sisters upon Terra eventually numbered near three thousand, and Guilliman declared them the Vigil Indomitus. They would be the first in a spreading network of vigils throughout the Imperium, each granted the explicit authority to carry out their ancient duties. The Vigil Indomitus divided into cadres, with each joining the battle groups of the Indomitus Crusade fleets.</p>\n<p>There had once been a large population of Sisters of Silence during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. Though numerous enough to play a role in the War of the Beast a thousand standard years after the end of the Heresy, by the late 41st Millennium they had dwindled almost to extinction. The militant orders of the Emperor's day had been disbanded, diminished, or lost to war.</p>\n<p>The last surviving few were scattered around the Imperium, most reduced to a handful of members. They had fought on, here and there, but their glory days were a myth at best. They were unremembered by the people they had died to protect.</p>\n<p>But after thousands of standard years of obscurity, when Guilliman returned, the Sisters of Silence came back willingly into the light, not because of who he was, but because of what he was. To them, the Primarch was a Living Saint.</p>\n<p>No longer centralised within the vast spire-convents of Luna, the Sisterhood has recently re-established a presence in every Segmentum, forming many new orders and offshoots. Some are charged with specific duties -- such as infiltrating the hyperspatial tunnels of the Webway to stymie the plans of psychic xenos races, recovering Pariahs from enemy forces that seek to use them for their own gain, or neutralizing spectral attacks in strategically vital locations.</p>\n<p>Others have carte blanche to pursue their own agendas, provided they culminate in the destruction of the Archenemy's forces. If there is any quality these genetic deviants share in abundance, it is self-reliance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Vow of Tranquility</h3>\n<p>Each Sister swears an oath of silence known as the Vow of Tranquility upon being nominated for Sisterhood; before this, when they are novices, they are allowed to converse normally. Amongst their other duties novices sometimes act as interpreters between senior Sisters and other agents of the Imperium.</p>\n<p>Thoughtmark is one of the symbolic sign languages employed by the Silent Sisterhood. Full of delicate gestures of finger and thumb, it served to convey concepts of great subtlety or intricate nature.</p>\n<p>Battlemark was the command sign language used by the Sisters to communicate on the battlefield.

In the wake of the Horus Heresy, they vanished almost entirely from the Imperium, and the order was wrongfully believed to have been disbanded.</p>\n<p>Yet the Sisters of Silence have recently returned to prominence in the Imperium of Man following the birth of the Great Rift and the start of the Era Indomitus.</p>\n<p>The Sisters of Silence's original purpose was to hunt and kill rogue human psykers whose activities presented a terrible danger to the people of the newborn Imperium of Man and to oversee the tithe of psykers from every Imperial world to Terra</p>\n<p>Each one of the warriors of this order are psychic Nulls, a soulless being who inspires dread wherever they walk. The Sisters of Silence's primary base of operations was the Somnus Citadel on Luna, the moon of Terra, which was maintained by the ancient Selenite Cults of gene-engineers who had long governed that world</p>\n<p>As Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade took shape and the first fleets were mustered, bands of Silent Sisters converged on Terra from every direction. Each isolated group had met different challenges through the generations, diverging to overcome them as necessity dictated. The tactics, characters, and traditions of each group were far removed from each other, but their collective sense of duty was undimmed.</p>\n<p>The hosts of Silent Sisters upon Terra eventually numbered near three thousand, and Guilliman declared them the Vigil Indomitus. They would be the first in a spreading network of vigils throughout the Imperium, each granted the explicit authority to carry out their ancient duties. The Vigil Indomitus divided into cadres, with each joining the battle groups of the Indomitus Crusade fleets.</p>\n<p>There had once been a large population of Sisters of Silence during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. Though numerous enough to play a role in the War of the Beast a thousand standard years after the end of the Heresy, by the late 41st Millennium they had dwindled almost to extinction. The militant orders of the Emperor's day had been disbanded, diminished, or lost to war.</p>\n<p>The last surviving few were scattered around the Imperium, most reduced to a handful of members. They had fought on, here and there, but their glory days were a myth at best. They were unremembered by the people they had died to protect.</p>\n<p>But after thousands of standard years of obscurity, when Guilliman returned, the Sisters of Silence came back willingly into the light, not because of who he was, but because of what he was. To them, the Primarch was a Living Saint.</p>\n<p>No longer centralised within the vast spire-convents of Luna, the Sisterhood has recently re-established a presence in every Segmentum, forming many new orders and offshoots. Some are charged with specific duties -- such as infiltrating the hyperspatial tunnels of the Webway to stymie the plans of psychic xenos races, recovering Pariahs from enemy forces that seek to use them for their own gain, or neutralizing spectral attacks in strategically vital locations.</p>\n<p>Others have carte blanche to pursue their own agendas, provided they culminate in the destruction of the Archenemy's forces. If there is any quality these genetic deviants share in abundance, it is self-reliance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Vow of Tranquility</h3>\n<p>Each Sister swears an oath of silence known as the Vow of Tranquility upon being nominated for Sisterhood; before this, when they are novices, they are allowed to converse normally.

They have been granted the right by the High Lords of Terra to serve as judge, jury, and executioner to any Imperial citizen they discover having broken Imperial law.</p>\n<p>However, in those cases where Imperial law is unclear or the law breaker has committed a truly heinous deed or is of unusually high-ranking stature, the offender will be taken back to an Arbites Precinct House for judgement by a Magistrate or Judge, the sentence to be carried out immediately. Imperial justice is swift and sure, but not always just.</p>\n<p>Only through constant watch and the execution of brutal law can the Imperium survive, and it is the Adeptus Arbites who carry out this function. While the armies of the Astra Militarum struggle to hold back the aggression of alien empires and protect the worlds of Mankind from without, the Adeptus Arbites roots out rebels, recidivists, and threats to the stability of the Imperium from within.</p>\n<p>They operate as they best see fit, using their greater training and weaponry to tackle foes that might be beyond the scope of local Enforcers, or in many cases to deal with a planetary government which has itself become corrupted. Remorseless and singleminded, the Arbites do not forgive or forget any crime, and pursue their quarry relentlessly until the Emperor's Justice has been served.</p>\n<p>The laws of the Imperium of Man are a complex web of tradition, obligation, and local custom. Thus, they can vary from world to world or sector to sector, with each Planetary Governor, local prefect, or headman pronouncing his own laws. Arbitors care little for such trivialities and enforce the serious crimes against the Imperium while leaving such petty matters to local officials. Murder or theft, for example, are considered inconsequential unless they affect the Imperium directly, are perpetrated against Imperial officials, or somehow fundamentally threaten a world’s security or safety.</p>\n<p>Arbitors have little pity or compassion for the transgressions of Imperial citizens. A few might maintain idealistic notions for bringing order to the Imperium, but the realities of endless, sometimes horrific crimes constantly erode such notions. The arrival of an Arbitrator patrol is seldom welcome, given the brutal way in which they operate during their investigations, arrests, and executions, even though it might mean an end to vicious criminal enterprises or corrupt Imperial or planetary officials.</p>\n<p>Arbitors must deal with ineffectual or corrupt local government agencies. These are often an Arbitor’s greatest foes as he must clean up a local situation, taking over the Enforcers of a hive city, orbital station, or even entire planet to purge it of crime and corruption in a series of bloody and unforgiving sweeps.</p>\n<p>On Imperial worlds the Adeptus Arbites are the last, most absolute law, answering only to the Marshalls and Judges of star systems and entire sectors, and not to local authorities. It is a thankless task, for the anonymous, helmeted Arbitrator usually only receives fear and hatred for his actions.</p>\n<p>To ensure their loyalty is to the Imperium and the Law first, foremost, and only, Arbitors never serve on the world upon which they were born. Indeed, they will receive training on one world and then be deployed to another entirely, ensuring that bonds of local familiarity cannot compromise enforcement of the law. This often means that Arbites are well-travelled, with veterans having served on several worlds across multiple sectors during their storied careers.</p>\n<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> <em>The Adeptus Arbites as presented in this document are based on the Arbites as depicted in the Shira Calpurnia novels by Matt Farrer, which are available <a href=\"https:/www.blacklibrary.com/warhammer-40000/novels/enforcer-omnibus-ebook.html\">here</a>, but using the term Magistrates rather than Judges to describe the legal side of the Arbites.</em></p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%;height:1238px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:99.5703%;height:17px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\">ADEPTUS ARBITES ARCHETYPES</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:17px\">Tier</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:17px\">Archetype</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:17px\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Enforcer</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">Local law enforcement, often aligned with or deputised by the Arbites</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:68px;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Arbitrator</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">An armoured enforcer of the Emperor's Law, unyielding in their devotion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Magistrate</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A scholar of the Law, passing judgement upon the guilty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Detective</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A specialised investigator, assigned to solve more complex crimes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:51px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:51px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:51px\">Chastener</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:51px\">A dogged pursuer of those who would flee the Emperor's judgment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Verispex Adept</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A technician who studies the sceneof crimes to uncover evidence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:31px\">\n<td style=\"width:99.5703%;height:31px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\">\n<p>ADEPTUS ARBITES BACKGROUNDS</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:17px;text-align:center\">[[/r d3]]</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:17px\">Origin</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:17px;text-align:right\">Gain +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:51px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:51px;text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:51px\"><strong>Progena: </strong>Your parents were stalwart servants of the Throne, and after their deaths, you were raised by the Schola Progenium, who identified your talents and groomed you to join the Adeptus Arbites.</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:51px;text-align:right\">Influence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:85px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:85px;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:85px\"><strong>Repentant:</strong> You once lived a life of criminality and desperation before you found the Emperor’s light and saw the error of your ways.

They have been granted the right by the High Lords of Terra to serve as judge, jury, and executioner to any Imperial citizen they discover having broken Imperial law.</p>\n<p>However, in those cases where Imperial law is unclear or the law breaker has committed a truly heinous deed or is of unusually high-ranking stature, the offender will be taken back to an Arbites Precinct House for judgement by a Magistrate or Judge, the sentence to be carried out immediately. Imperial justice is swift and sure, but not always just.</p>\n<p>Only through constant watch and the execution of brutal law can the Imperium survive, and it is the Adeptus Arbites who carry out this function. While the armies of the Astra Militarum struggle to hold back the aggression of alien empires and protect the worlds of Mankind from without, the Adeptus Arbites roots out rebels, recidivists, and threats to the stability of the Imperium from within.</p>\n<p>They operate as they best see fit, using their greater training and weaponry to tackle foes that might be beyond the scope of local Enforcers, or in many cases to deal with a planetary government which has itself become corrupted. Remorseless and singleminded, the Arbites do not forgive or forget any crime, and pursue their quarry relentlessly until the Emperor's Justice has been served.</p>\n<p>The laws of the Imperium of Man are a complex web of tradition, obligation, and local custom. Thus, they can vary from world to world or sector to sector, with each Planetary Governor, local prefect, or headman pronouncing his own laws. Arbitors care little for such trivialities and enforce the serious crimes against the Imperium while leaving such petty matters to local officials. Murder or theft, for example, are considered inconsequential unless they affect the Imperium directly, are perpetrated against Imperial officials, or somehow fundamentally threaten a world’s security or safety.</p>\n<p>Arbitors have little pity or compassion for the transgressions of Imperial citizens. A few might maintain idealistic notions for bringing order to the Imperium, but the realities of endless, sometimes horrific crimes constantly erode such notions. The arrival of an Arbitrator patrol is seldom welcome, given the brutal way in which they operate during their investigations, arrests, and executions, even though it might mean an end to vicious criminal enterprises or corrupt Imperial or planetary officials.</p>\n<p>Arbitors must deal with ineffectual or corrupt local government agencies. These are often an Arbitor’s greatest foes as he must clean up a local situation, taking over the Enforcers of a hive city, orbital station, or even entire planet to purge it of crime and corruption in a series of bloody and unforgiving sweeps.</p>\n<p>On Imperial worlds the Adeptus Arbites are the last, most absolute law, answering only to the Marshalls and Judges of star systems and entire sectors, and not to local authorities. It is a thankless task, for the anonymous, helmeted Arbitrator usually only receives fear and hatred for his actions.</p>\n<p>To ensure their loyalty is to the Imperium and the Law first, foremost, and only, Arbitors never serve on the world upon which they were born. Indeed, they will receive training on one world and then be deployed to another entirely, ensuring that bonds of local familiarity cannot compromise enforcement of the law. This often means that Arbites are well-travelled, with veterans having served on several worlds across multiple sectors during their storied careers.</p>\n<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> <em>The Adeptus Arbites as presented in this document are based on the Arbites as depicted in the Shira Calpurnia novels by Matt Farrer, which are available <a href=\"https:/www.blacklibrary.com/warhammer-40000/novels/enforcer-omnibus-ebook.html\">here</a>, but using the term Magistrates rather than Judges to describe the legal side of the Arbites.</em></p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%;height:1238px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:99.5703%;height:17px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\">ADEPTUS ARBITES ARCHETYPES</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:17px\">Tier</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:17px\">Archetype</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:17px\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Enforcer</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">Local law enforcement, often aligned with or deputised by the Arbites</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:68px;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Arbitrator</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">An armoured enforcer of the Emperor's Law, unyielding in their devotion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Magistrate</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A scholar of the Law, passing judgement upon the guilty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Detective</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A specialised investigator, assigned to solve more complex crimes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:51px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:51px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:51px\">Chastener</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:51px\">A dogged pursuer of those who would flee the Emperor's judgment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:68px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;text-align:center;height:68px\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:68px\">Verispex Adept</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:68px\">A technician who studies the sceneof crimes to uncover evidence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:31px\">\n<td style=\"width:99.5703%;height:31px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\">\n<p>ADEPTUS ARBITES BACKGROUNDS</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:17px;text-align:center\">[[/r d3]]</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:17px\">Origin</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:17px;text-align:right\">Gain +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:51px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:51px;text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:51px\"><strong>Progena: </strong>Your parents were stalwart servants of the Throne, and after their deaths, you were raised by the Schola Progenium, who identified your talents and groomed you to join the Adeptus Arbites.</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.8121%;height:51px;text-align:right\">Influence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:85px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.4642%;height:85px;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.294%;height:85px\"><strong>Repentant:</strong> You once lived a life of criminality and desperation before you found the Emperor’s light and saw the error of your ways.

They are to the Space Marines as the Emperor is to His Primarchs, and it is rumoured that they were each created by the Master of Mankind personally.</p>\n<p>These warriors have stood in the presence of the immortal Emperor of Mankind since before the time of the Unification Wars. For ten thousand Terran years and more, the Custodians have stood watch over their lord and master, serving as the Emperor's personal heralds and praetorian bodyguard.</p>\n<p>During the Great Crusade, these resplendent warriors guarded the Emperor wherever He went and swore to give their lives to protect His. After His incarceration in the Golden Throne following the Horus Heresy ten millennia ago, they have taken a far more limited role in the Imperium of Man.</p>\n<p>With the birth of the Great Rift in the Era Indomitus, and the resurrection of the Primarch Roboute Guilliman as the Lord Commander of the Imperium, the Adeptus Custodes have been forced to take a more active role in galactic affairs. A force of Custodians has followed Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade out into the galaxy, often serving as the heralds of a Torchbearers fleet.</p>\n<p>As befits such a body of elite warriors, the internal hierarchy of the Adeptus Custodes is remarkably flat. The overall command of the Adeptus Custodes of course lies within the purview of the Emperor directly, but serving as the head of the Order is a single officer; the Captain-General, and due to the importance of the Adeptus Custodes in the governing of the Imperium, since they always stand the closest to the Emperor, the Captain-General often holds a position amongst the ruling High Lords of Terra on the Senatorum Imperialis. The Captain-General commands the Ten Thousand, inheriting a post that has been passed down from one gallant leader to the next ever since the mysterious disappearance of Constantin Valdor. The Captain General has absolute authority over the Custodes, acting as the ritual proxy for the Emperor Himself and speaking with the voice of the Master of Mankind.</p>\n<p>Immediately below the absolute authority of the Captain-General were the two Tribunes, the senior members of the Custodian Tribunate; a senior cadre of ten veteran Custodians, forming the Adeptus Custodes' council of war and policy who acted as advisors to the Captain General. This body has the incomparable privilege of providing their services as counsel to the Emperor Himself should He so desire it, and in the matters of the security of the Imperial Palace's inner sanctums and the person of the Emperor, no higher authority exists. Membership of this body changes periodically to ensure a blend of established wisdom and fresh ideas.</p>\n<p>Below this ruling council can be found the Custodian Prefectorate and the Shield Captains. The title of Prefect is accorded as a reward of veterancy and favour in service by the Emperor, while the rank of Shield Captain indicates an active field command over a particular detachment or deployment of the Custodes. These two ranks fulfil the roles of inspiring leaders, gifted generals, and selfless champions. Their titles vary enormously, from \"Supreme Castellans” and “Aquila Commanders” to “Master Guardians,” often borne in accordance with the specific duties to which they have been assigned.

They are to the Space Marines as the Emperor is to His Primarchs, and it is rumoured that they were each created by the Master of Mankind personally.</p>\n<p>These warriors have stood in the presence of the immortal Emperor of Mankind since before the time of the Unification Wars. For ten thousand Terran years and more, the Custodians have stood watch over their lord and master, serving as the Emperor's personal heralds and praetorian bodyguard.</p>\n<p>During the Great Crusade, these resplendent warriors guarded the Emperor wherever He went and swore to give their lives to protect His. After His incarceration in the Golden Throne following the Horus Heresy ten millennia ago, they have taken a far more limited role in the Imperium of Man.</p>\n<p>With the birth of the Great Rift in the Era Indomitus, and the resurrection of the Primarch Roboute Guilliman as the Lord Commander of the Imperium, the Adeptus Custodes have been forced to take a more active role in galactic affairs. A force of Custodians has followed Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade out into the galaxy, often serving as the heralds of a Torchbearers fleet.</p>\n<p>As befits such a body of elite warriors, the internal hierarchy of the Adeptus Custodes is remarkably flat. The overall command of the Adeptus Custodes of course lies within the purview of the Emperor directly, but serving as the head of the Order is a single officer; the Captain-General, and due to the importance of the Adeptus Custodes in the governing of the Imperium, since they always stand the closest to the Emperor, the Captain-General often holds a position amongst the ruling High Lords of Terra on the Senatorum Imperialis. The Captain-General commands the Ten Thousand, inheriting a post that has been passed down from one gallant leader to the next ever since the mysterious disappearance of Constantin Valdor. The Captain General has absolute authority over the Custodes, acting as the ritual proxy for the Emperor Himself and speaking with the voice of the Master of Mankind.</p>\n<p>Immediately below the absolute authority of the Captain-General were the two Tribunes, the senior members of the Custodian Tribunate; a senior cadre of ten veteran Custodians, forming the Adeptus Custodes' council of war and policy who acted as advisors to the Captain General. This body has the incomparable privilege of providing their services as counsel to the Emperor Himself should He so desire it, and in the matters of the security of the Imperial Palace's inner sanctums and the person of the Emperor, no higher authority exists. Membership of this body changes periodically to ensure a blend of established wisdom and fresh ideas.</p>\n<p>Below this ruling council can be found the Custodian Prefectorate and the Shield Captains. The title of Prefect is accorded as a reward of veterancy and favour in service by the Emperor, while the rank of Shield Captain indicates an active field command over a particular detachment or deployment of the Custodes. These two ranks fulfil the roles of inspiring leaders, gifted generals, and selfless champions. Their titles vary enormously, from \"Supreme Castellans” and “Aquila Commanders” to “Master Guardians,” often borne in accordance with the specific duties to which they have been assigned. It is Shield-Captains that take charge of the Adeptus Custodes' military engagements; one is typically afforded overall command of an operation, while several others of his rank may lend him their strength and wisdom in a supporting capacity. </p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%;height:731px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:100.072%;height:17px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\">ADEPTUS CUSTODES ARCHETYPES</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\">\n<td style=\"width:12.509%;height:17px\">Tier</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.6033%;height:17px\">Archetype</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.9595%;height:17px\">Description</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.509%;text-align:center;height:34px\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.6033%;height:34px\">Custodian Guard</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.9595%;height:34px\">The Emperor's personal guard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:100.072%;height:17px;text-align:center;background-color:#752322;color:#dddddd\" colspan=\"3\">ADEPTUS CUSTODES BACKGROUNDS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px;background-color:#484746;color:#dddddd\">\n<td style=\"width:12.509%;height:17px;text-align:center\">[[/r d3]]</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.6033%;height:17px\">Origin</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.9595%;height:17px;text-align:right\">Gain +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.509%;height:34px;text-align:center\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.6033%;height:34px\"><strong>Privilege:</strong> You were selected from amongst the wealthy and powerful families of Holy Terra as a small child.</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.9595%;height:34px;text-align:right\">Influence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.509%;height:34px;text-align:center\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.6033%;height:34px\"><strong>Prophesy: </strong>Your place in the Custodian Guard was foretold and you were sough out as a child to ensure that your fate came to pass.</td>\n<td style=\"width:22.9595%;height:34px;text-align:right\">Resolve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:12.509%;height:34px;text-align:center\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:64.6033%;height:34px\"><strong>Provenance: </strong>During a Custodes action, you were noticed, and your potential discovered.

In the wake of the Horus Heresy, they vanished almost entirely from the Imperium, and the order was wrongfully believed to have been disbanded.</p>\n<p>Yet the Sisters of Silence have recently returned to prominence in the Imperium of Man following the birth of the Great Rift and the start of the Era Indomitus.</p>\n<p>The Sisters of Silence's original purpose was to hunt and kill rogue human psykers whose activities presented a terrible danger to the people of the newborn Imperium of Man and to oversee the tithe of psykers from every Imperial world to Terra</p>\n<p>Each one of the warriors of this order are psychic Nulls, a soulless being who inspires dread wherever they walk. The Sisters of Silence's primary base of operations was the Somnus Citadel on Luna, the moon of Terra, which was maintained by the ancient Selenite Cults of gene-engineers who had long governed that world</p>\n<p>As Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade took shape and the first fleets were mustered, bands of Silent Sisters converged on Terra from every direction. Each isolated group had met different challenges through the generations, diverging to overcome them as necessity dictated. The tactics, characters, and traditions of each group were far removed from each other, but their collective sense of duty was undimmed.</p>\n<p>The hosts of Silent Sisters upon Terra eventually numbered near three thousand, and Guilliman declared them the Vigil Indomitus. They would be the first in a spreading network of vigils throughout the Imperium, each granted the explicit authority to carry out their ancient duties. The Vigil Indomitus divided into cadres, with each joining the battle groups of the Indomitus Crusade fleets.</p>\n<p>There had once been a large population of Sisters of Silence during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. Though numerous enough to play a role in the War of the Beast a thousand standard years after the end of the Heresy, by the late 41st Millennium they had dwindled almost to extinction. The militant orders of the Emperor's day had been disbanded, diminished, or lost to war.</p>\n<p>The last surviving few were scattered around the Imperium, most reduced to a handful of members. They had fought on, here and there, but their glory days were a myth at best. They were unremembered by the people they had died to protect.</p>\n<p>But after thousands of standard years of obscurity, when Guilliman returned, the Sisters of Silence came back willingly into the light, not because of who he was, but because of what he was. To them, the Primarch was a Living Saint.</p>\n<p>No longer centralised within the vast spire-convents of Luna, the Sisterhood has recently re-established a presence in every Segmentum, forming many new orders and offshoots. Some are charged with specific duties -- such as infiltrating the hyperspatial tunnels of the Webway to stymie the plans of psychic xenos races, recovering Pariahs from enemy forces that seek to use them for their own gain, or neutralizing spectral attacks in strategically vital locations.</p>\n<p>Others have carte blanche to pursue their own agendas, provided they culminate in the destruction of the Archenemy's forces. If there is any quality these genetic deviants share in abundance, it is self-reliance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Vow of Tranquility</h3>\n<p>Each Sister swears an oath of silence known as the Vow of Tranquility upon being nominated for Sisterhood; before this, when they are novices, they are allowed to converse normally. Amongst their other duties novices sometimes act as interpreters between senior Sisters and other agents of the Imperium.</p>\n<p>Thoughtmark is one of the symbolic sign languages employed by the Silent Sisterhood.

In the wake of the Horus Heresy, they vanished almost entirely from the Imperium, and the order was wrongfully believed to have been disbanded.</p>\n<p>Yet the Sisters of Silence have recently returned to prominence in the Imperium of Man following the birth of the Great Rift and the start of the Era Indomitus.</p>\n<p>The Sisters of Silence's original purpose was to hunt and kill rogue human psykers whose activities presented a terrible danger to the people of the newborn Imperium of Man and to oversee the tithe of psykers from every Imperial world to Terra</p>\n<p>Each one of the warriors of this order are psychic Nulls, a soulless being who inspires dread wherever they walk. The Sisters of Silence's primary base of operations was the Somnus Citadel on Luna, the moon of Terra, which was maintained by the ancient Selenite Cults of gene-engineers who had long governed that world</p>\n<p>As Guilliman's Indomitus Crusade took shape and the first fleets were mustered, bands of Silent Sisters converged on Terra from every direction. Each isolated group had met different challenges through the generations, diverging to overcome them as necessity dictated. The tactics, characters, and traditions of each group were far removed from each other, but their collective sense of duty was undimmed.</p>\n<p>The hosts of Silent Sisters upon Terra eventually numbered near three thousand, and Guilliman declared them the Vigil Indomitus. They would be the first in a spreading network of vigils throughout the Imperium, each granted the explicit authority to carry out their ancient duties. The Vigil Indomitus divided into cadres, with each joining the battle groups of the Indomitus Crusade fleets.</p>\n<p>There had once been a large population of Sisters of Silence during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. Though numerous enough to play a role in the War of the Beast a thousand standard years after the end of the Heresy, by the late 41st Millennium they had dwindled almost to extinction. The militant orders of the Emperor's day had been disbanded, diminished, or lost to war.</p>\n<p>The last surviving few were scattered around the Imperium, most reduced to a handful of members. They had fought on, here and there, but their glory days were a myth at best. They were unremembered by the people they had died to protect.</p>\n<p>But after thousands of standard years of obscurity, when Guilliman returned, the Sisters of Silence came back willingly into the light, not because of who he was, but because of what he was. To them, the Primarch was a Living Saint.</p>\n<p>No longer centralised within the vast spire-convents of Luna, the Sisterhood has recently re-established a presence in every Segmentum, forming many new orders and offshoots. Some are charged with specific duties -- such as infiltrating the hyperspatial tunnels of the Webway to stymie the plans of psychic xenos races, recovering Pariahs from enemy forces that seek to use them for their own gain, or neutralizing spectral attacks in strategically vital locations.</p>\n<p>Others have carte blanche to pursue their own agendas, provided they culminate in the destruction of the Archenemy's forces. If there is any quality these genetic deviants share in abundance, it is self-reliance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3>Vow of Tranquility</h3>\n<p>Each Sister swears an oath of silence known as the Vow of Tranquility upon being nominated for Sisterhood; before this, when they are novices, they are allowed to converse normally.

They are profoundly vigilant, maintaining a perfect awareness of any threat to the Emperor, and they continually seek to refine their knowledge, hone their skills, and master themselves even more fully so that they do not fail in their duty again.</p>\n<h5><strong>Custodian Names</strong></h5>\n<p>The Custodes have an unusual relationship with names. Their original, true names, the ones which they bore at birth, are secret, recorded nowhere. Instead, each Custodian answers to a name of their choosing, often some moniker of note from Terran history or legend. Each accepts additional names throughout their lives, etched microscopically within their armour as a testament to their accomplishments; the mightiest Custodians may have dozens, even hundreds of names. Examples include:</p>\n<p>Tybalus, Aetheus, Dalat, Kariyan, Basillaeus, Tristraen, Erasmian, Heracal, Tauramacchis, Nurthias, Hasturias, Artoris, Nathadian, Io, Harkhas, Constantin, Eratorius, Archimallus.</p>\n<h3><strong>Playing a Custodian</strong></h3>\n<p>If you wish to play a Custodian character, use the following species entry.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 330</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 5, Fellowship 3, Initiative 5, Intellect 3, Strength 6, Toughness 6, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics 4, Awareness 5, Ballistic Skill 4, Insight 3, Scholar 2, Stealth 3, Weapon Skill 4</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 7</p>\n<p><strong>Aegis of the Emperor:</strong> A Custodian may roll Determination against Mortal Wounds. Indomitable, Incorruptible: You add +2 to your Resolve, and you automatically succeed on all Corruption Tests. Your Maximum Wounds are increased by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Solitary:</strong> A Custodian maintains a unique pool of Glory. They may save up to 3 points of Glory, and they cannot save points into the group pool nor can they spend Glory generated by anyone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Despised by the Unholy:</strong> If a Custodian is present in a game, the GM’s starting and maximum Ruin are increased by 1.</p>\n<h5><strong>Additional Details </strong></h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Custodes are functionally immortal and will persist for centuries or millennia if not slain through extreme violence. If you’re randomly rolling for a Custodian character’s age, roll 4d6 x 5, and then multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> As transhumans, Custodians possess a similar range and variety of skin pigments, hair colours, and eye colours to baseline humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> Custodians typically stand taller than the Astartes and are close in height to the Primarchs of old. If you’re randomly rolling a Custodian character’s height, roll 8’ +2d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The Custodians speak Low Gothic and High Gothic and are often fluent in numerous obscure historical human languages, as well as other forms of communication, including the Thoughtmark and Battlemark sign languages used by the Silent Sisterhood, and Astartes battle-sign.</p>"},"_id":"zP4s74z3g5ktvIOa","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664128918204,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"}}

A character hit by a Luminagen weapon cannot benefit from being in cover until the start of their next turn.</p><h4>Mortal (X)</h4><p>The weapon deals horrific, deadly wounds that are nigh-impossible to withstand. For each Exalted Icon you roll on the weapon’s ED, you inflict X Mortal Wounds, in addition to any damage the attack inflicts.</p><h4>Nemesis</h4><p>Nemesis weapons are created to be bane to daemons. @UUID[Item.eeSvJvzZBjQvtZq0]{DAEMONS }may not roll Determination to negate wounds or mortal wounds inflicted by Nemesis weapons.</p><h4>Overwhelming</h4><p>The weapon can batter past even the most proficient defence. When you make an attack with an Overwhelming weapon, the target does not benefit from the Parry trait of any of their weapons or the Defence bonus from Shields.</p><h4>Paired</h4><p>The weapon is designed to be used in a pair—two weapons of that type, one in each hand. When a character makes an attack while wielding both weapons in a pair, either count it as a Simultaneous Strike (as per the talent), or reduce the DN of a multiattack by 2. If you have the Signature Weapon talent, you may apply it to both weapons in a pair.</p><h4>Poisonous</h4><p>The weapon delivers a virulent toxin that inflicts grievous harm with only the slightest scratch. The weapon’s base damage is increased by the target’s Toughness. This has no effect against Vehicles.</p><h4>Reaping</h4><p>The weapon is intended to scythe through groups of foes. When you make a Multi-Attack with this weapon, the DN increases by +1 per additional target, rather than +2.</p><h4>Tearing</h4><p>The weapon rips and tears at their enemies, inflicting horrific wounds. When you roll for damage with this weapon, you may re-roll any number of ED.</p><h4>Tesla</h4><p>The weapon fires arcs of crackling lightning, leaping from foe to foe. When you shift Exalted Icons from a successful attack, you may shift Exalted Icons to hit enemies within 3m of an existing target as well as the main target, using the weapon’s normal damage and AP. Each Exalted Icon shifted may only be used to hit additional enemies or to gain +ED, not both.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ZFKuifc3mGn2RgTb.JournalEntryPage.anBLJX16REDKapOs"}}}],"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_edpbxmeck8v","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Wargear","color":"#000000"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1664024464297,"modifiedTime":1664128918374,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"},"_id":"ZFKuifc3mGn2RgTb","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3}}
