Variations include the size and dimensions of the skull and the removal of the crossed lightning bolts or bones or their scale in relation to the shape of the cruciform. The Crux Terminatus is almost always worn on the left shoulder pad, though it may also be worn on one knee pad (this is usually done only in combination with the shoulder pad, however). Legend has it that the first Crux Terminatus ever crafted contained a tiny fragment of the Emperor's own armour within it, an honour granted to commemorate a squad of Imperial Fists Terminators who aided the Emperor in the battle against Horus. Whether or not this is true it means that ancient suits of power armour bearing Terminator Honours are considered even more rare and precious to a Chapter as a result of their reputed connection to the Master of the Imperium.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","requirements":"Ballistic Skill 5+ or Weapon Skill 5+, Adeptus Astartes Species","keywords":"","influence":2,"benefits":""},"ownership":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"wrath-and-glory","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664211875967,"lastModifiedBy":"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM"}}

Unlike other forms of personal protection, a Displacer Field emitter is something of an unreliable technology, since it relies on the manipulation of the Warp for its function. When an individual wearing a Displacer Field emitter is struck by a blow from a melee weapon or fire from a ranged weapon that carries sufficient force, the Displacer Field will activate and teleport the user through the Warp to another position in the local realspace that is out of harm's way.</p>\n<p>However, the use of this device carries several risks. All teleportation technology is inherently dangerous, since it moves an individual through the Warp. Even the brief exposure of a few solar milliseconds can be dangerous if the local Warp is infested by daemons or other dangerous denizens of the Empyrean. Second, for the Displacer Field to function properly, it must be set to automatically teleport its user, and that user will not be able to control the moment of teleportation or exactly where the device will teleport them. Finally, the user will return to realspace moving at the exact same speed and in the same direction with the same momentum as when the field was activated. Depending upon where the user ends up, this can be extremely dangerous.</p>\n<p>When hit by an attack while protected by a displacer field, roll a number of dice equal to the number of ED used on the damage roll. If any of them roll Icons, then the field activates, moving the character a number of metres equal to the number of Icons rolled in a random direction instantly. If the field activates, the attack misses, unless it was a blast or area effect (in which case, it still affects the area, which the character may still be within).

The Chapters of the Space Marines are arch traditionalists, and some are conservative in the extreme, having upheld the same warrior traditions for thousands of Terran years. Of course, the express command of Roboute Guilliman as the Lord Commander of the Imperium eased the transition into the new era.</p>\n<p>For the Ultramarines and the vast majority of their Successor Chapters, the word of their risen Primarch was good enough, and many Chapters welcomed the Primaris Battle-Brothers gladly. But there were those especially secretive or wilful Chapters who saw the incorporation of the Primaris Marines into their ranks as a dilution of their gene-stock and a betrayal of their long-held culture.</p>\n<p>Some amongst the Adeptus Astartes suspected that the Primaris Marines, being stronger, more durable and closer in blood to the Primarchs themselves, represented the obsolescence of the traditional Astartes. No amount of reason&mdash;of pointing out that what the Primaris offered in raw ability, they lacked in experience and versatility&mdash;could salve the spiritual wound dealt by the sight of the newcomers wearing their Chapter heraldry.</p>\n<p>The Primaris Marines of the Ultima Founding had been swiftly inducted into brotherhoods that the incepted Aspirants of yesteryear had given everything they had to join. Questions, heavy with the weight of Mankind's destiny, hung in the air. Would the Primaris Marines ultimately render the traditional Space Marines extinct? Would the identity of each Chapter's homeworld be diluted, with so many thousands of new recruits sourced from the stasis vaults of Mars? And was it possible for a Space Marine to be transformed into a Primaris, inheriting the benefits of Adeptus Mechanicus arcanoscience whilst retaining his personality and experience?</p>\n<p>This last question had been raised in Adeptus Astartes Chapters across the galaxy. It was a query Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines, had asked of Belisarius Cawl himself, and had discussed with those of his fellow Chapter Masters he was able to meet in person.</p>\n<p>Debate raged as to whether such an act was even possible without having deadly consequences for the recipient -- for data that Archmagos Cawl had already amassed on the subject suggested there would be a 61.6% failure rate at such a transformation until the process could be perfected, which would take time. Then there was the moral concern of whether the process should be attempted at all.</p>\n<p>The dilemma proved divisive. There were those who claimed that this was the ultimate destiny of all Adeptus Astartes, while from other quarters came whispers of rejection, even mutiny, at the prospect.</p>\n<p>The lords of the Ultramarines concluded that to ease the transition from centuries of Imperial tradition to a new order, the theoreticals of that raging debate needed to be put into practice. It was Marneus Calgar who stepped forward as the first test subject from the ranks of his storied Chapter.
